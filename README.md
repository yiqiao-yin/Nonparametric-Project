# Intro

Through several parametric and nonparametric statistical methods, such as t-test, correlation tests,
and interaction tests, the goal of this study is to determine the significant predictor variable(s) to
classify the income level and figure out their relationships, based on the data extracted from the 1994
U.S. Census database. According to U.S. Census Bureau data from 1994, the median 
household income is around $50,000 per year, so the dataset separate people into two groups, one of
which had an annual income over $50,000 and the other had not. In addition, the data set consists of a
random sample of 48,842 persons with 8 predictor variables, including age, education, hours/week,
gender, race, native country, workclass, and occupation, towards income. The detailed data
description will be shown in Table.1 in Part6: Attachment. By taking 0.05 as the significant level in
the whole project and through the various test methods, the results show that age, education, gender,
and working hours per week are the 4 most important and informative variables that influence
peopleâ€™s annual income
